# Auto_Suspend_Difficult_To_Learn_cards_Anki
This is an addon that after a predefined number of lapses will auto suspend and tag a card.What it does
# The reason for this addon
Certain cards are so difficult to learn no matter how many times they are repped they fail to graduated. Cards like that are best to be identified and removed from the que. So that they can be reformatted.

# Thanks
A big thanks to the addon KillZone without which I wouldn't be able to figure out how to write the addon
